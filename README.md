# About AISer

This script, named aiser.sh, is designed to enhance your shell experience by providing helpful insights and suggestions through the use of AI
based on the content you provide. By default, Ollama Zephyr is utilized as the AI model, but this can be easily customized by modifying the \`ai<sub>cmd</sub>\`
variable at the top of the file. This script prioritizes simplicity and full flexibility for users, allowing for configurable and controllable options.
When executed with one or more filenames as arguments, the script reads their contents (if they are files) and passes them along with some contextual
information to the AI for analysis, displaying the generated output on the screen for your review.
