1 About AISer
=============

  This script, named aiser.sh, is designed to enhance your shell
  experience by providing helpful insights and suggestions through the
  use of AI based on the content you provide. By default, Ollama Zephyr
  is utilized as the AI model, but this can be easily customized by
  modifying the `ai_cmd` variable at the top of the file. This script
  prioritizes simplicity and full flexibility for users, allowing for
  configurable and controllable options. When executed with one or more
  filenames as arguments, the script reads their contents (if they are
  files) and passes them along with some contextual information to the
  AI for analysis, displaying the generated output on the screen for
  your review.
