1 About AISer
=============

  This script, named aiser.sh, is designed to enhance your shell
  experience by using AI to provide helpful insights and suggestions
  based on the content you provide. The default AI model used in this
  script is Ollama Zephyr, but you can easily change it by modifying the
  `ai_cmd` variable at the top of the file.

  The script takes one or more filenames as arguments, reads their
  contents (if they are files), and passes them along with some
  contextual information to the AI for analysis. The output generated by
  the AI is displayed on the screen for your review.


2 Requirement
=============

  - Ollama and Zephyr model Follow instructions in [Ollama] to install
    and pull Zephyr model "ollama pull zephyr"


[Ollama] <https://github.com/ollama/ollama>


3 Usage
=======

  1. Open a terminal or command prompt window.
  2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the aiser.sh script.
  3. Make the script executable by running the following command: `chmod
     +x aiser.sh`
  4. The script will display the contents of each file, followed by a
     prompt asking you for some contextual information about the file(s)
     in question. Type
  your input and press Enter.
  1. The AI will generate a response based on the provided input, which
     will be displayed on the screen. You can review this output to get
     insights,
  suggestions, or clarifications related to the content of the file(s).


4 Examples
==========

4.1 hello_world.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  CMD: aiser.sh about hello_world.py output: """ about file
  hello_world.py
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  The provided Python script `hello_world.py` is a simple program that
  prints the string "Hello World!" using the built-in `print()`
  function. The shebang line at the beginning of the file specifies the
  path to the Python interpreter to be used when executing the script on
  Unix-like systems like Linux or macOS. In this case, we've specified
  `python3` as the interpreter using the `env` command. When you run
  this script, it will output "Hello World!" to the console. """


  Note: If you want to further customize your AI experience, you can
  modify the `ai_cmd` variable at the top of the script to use a
  different AI model or command.

  Enjoy exploring the possibilities of this script!
